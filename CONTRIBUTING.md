# How to contribute
The entire project is hosted and managed on
[its GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kumodatsu/ShoppingList).
If you experience a bug or would like to see a feature, you can open an issue
here.
You are free to download and modify the code.
If you want to submit a bug fix or feature, you can open a pull request.
You are also allowed to distribute your modifications yourself as long as you
retain the LICENSE file in your distributions and clearly state somewhere which
changes you have made.
However, I (Kumodatsu) still ask you open a pull request or contact me if you
think your modifications would be useful for other users of the addon, so that
I can include them in a future release.
This way I can also credit you for your contributions.
